# MediVision

MediVision is a smart medication integration tool designed to bridge the gap during care transitions (e.g., moving from hospital to home). Patients often struggle to reconcile new discharge prescriptions with their existing home medications. MediVision solves this by using AI to scan documents and pill bottles, automatically generating a unified, safe, and easy-to-read daily medication schedule.

**Key Features:**

- **AI-Powered OCR:** Uses Google Gemini Vision to read text from discharge summaries and round pill bottles (ignoring complex ingredient lists to focus on dosage instructions).
- **Unified Schedule:** Automatically merges instructions into a clear timeline (Morning, Noon, Evening, Bedtime).
- **Drag & Drop Upload:** Simply drag images of your documents or medicine bottles onto the screen.
- **PDF Export:** Download a clean, printable PDF of your medication schedule with one click.
- **Modern Design:** Features a clean, Apple-style aesthetic with interactive "Nexus Hexagon" cursor effects.
- **AI Branding:** Dynamically generates a unique cartoon doctor logo on startup.
